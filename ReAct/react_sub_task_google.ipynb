      "Cher reminded the world why she’s an icon at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards on Sunday night. With not one but two performances of her greatest hits and a Billboard Icon Award acceptance speech, she wowed the audience.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think luck has so much to do with my success. I think it was mostly luck with a little bit of something thrown in,” Cher said as her son Chaz Bono watched from the audience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cher joins an esteemed list of past award recipients, including Celine Dion, Prince, Jennifer Lopez, Stevie Wonder and Neil Diamond. With more than 100 million albums sold worldwide and a No. 1 single in every decade from the 1960s to the 2010s (she was the first artist to have a No. 1 single on a Billboard chart in each decade), Cher has certainly earned the honor of icon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gwen Stefani presented Cher with the award, saying:\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is an honor for me to be here tonight to present the Billboard Icon Award to a woman who is truly the definition of the word icon: Cher. From the first note you know it’s her. Her artistry, her commitment to her craft and her willingness to take on new creative challenges have served as an inspiration to me and my career and she continues to inspire. She has proven that there is nothing she can not do. Cher is trailblazer, a fashion trendsetter, truly iconic looks at every single point in her career, a role model for preservering and showing us how to be strong and how to be true to ourselves. She is a cultural influencer, a tireless activist and an incredible humanitarian who cares about our world and speaks out against injustices.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, Cher performed her hits “Believe” and “If I Could Turn Back Time” that were electrifying and got the audience on their feet. For “Believe,” she donned a bleach blonde wig, barely-there dress made of glittery silver strands accented by heart-shaped pasties and silver boots.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cher also busted out a huge black curly wig, black leather jacket, thigh-high boots and sparkling black bodysuit for a performance of her 1989 smash “If I Could Turn Back Time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "After performing her hits, she accepted the Billboard Icon Award with a humble speech that notably left out any mention of Donald Trump.\n",
      "\n",
      "“So, I’ve wanted to do what I do since I was four years-old. And I’ve been doing it for 53 years. That is not an applause thing, I’m 71 yesterday. And I can do a five-minute plank, okay? Just saying. I want to thank my mom. Because when I was really young she said, ‘You’re not going to be the smartest, you’re not going to be the prettiest, you’re not going to be the most talented, but you’re going to be special.’ And when I met Sonny he said the same thing. There was really nothing about me that led anyone to believe that I was going to be special.”\n",

      "\n",
      "Megan Markle will be marrying into class, status, and major wealth when she ties the royal knot with Prince Harry on May 19.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before she moved across the pond, Markle was earning close to half a million dollars a year starring in the USA Network drama \"Suits,\" plus a five-figure income from endorsement deals and sponsorships. Her total net worth is estimated to be $5 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's a sizable contribution to bring into any marriage, but when she marries Prince Harry, their combined net worth will be more than five times that. Prince Harry's net worth is at least $25 million (£18 million) and as much as $40 million (£28.7 million), according to estimates from Wealth-X.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's where all that money comes from.\n",
      "\n",
      "Along with Prince William and Kate Middleton, Harry receives an annual seven-figure allowance from his father and heir to the throne, Prince Charles, which is used to cover expenses like travel and wardrobe. Between April 2016 and March 2017, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Harry split nearly $5 million (£3.5 million) in allowance from their father, according to an annual review released by Clarence House.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prince Charles derives that money, in part, from a private estate called the Duchy of Cornwall, which has funded the royal family's public and private lives for nearly 700 years. The estate provided a total of $28.8 million (£20.7 million), including Harry and William's allowance, to Prince Charles and his wife Camilla between 2016 and 2017.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chris Jackson/Getty\n",
      "\n",
      "Since age 21, Harry and William have also been receiving a $450,000 a year investment profit from Princess Diana's estate, which they pay taxes on to the UK government. They received a sizeable inheritance from their late mother estimated to be around $10 million each, which each prince gained access to on his 30th birthday. Plus, during his 10 years in the British Royal Air Force, Harry earned an annual income of $50,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite a massive fortune, Markle and Harry reportedly will not sign a prenuptial agreement before their wedding, reported Business Insider's Shana Lebowtiz.\n",
      "\n",
      "A prenup is a smart choice for most couples who have sizable assets they want to protect in the event of a divorce, but for Harry — and William, who chose to forgo a prenup with Middleton — it doesn't make much sense. The princes likely don't have much property of their own, as the most valuable national treasures like the Crown Jewels or the Tower of London are part of the royal collection held by the Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, the merging of Harry and Markle's finances could \"cause tax headaches\" and create some \"mundane hurdles\" for the royal family, as The Washington Post first reported in November.\n",
      "\n",
      "Markle is a citizen of the US and is purportedly living in the UK on a family visa, according to the BBC. If she eventually becomes a dual US-UK citizen, Markle will have to continue filing her taxes each year with the IRS. If she has more than $300,000 in assets at any point during the year, she will have to file a specific form that details foreign assets, which could include foreign trusts, subjecting the royal family \"to outside scrutiny,\" according to the Post. But ultimately there are a lot of factors that come into play.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eddie Mulholland/AP\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The key for Meghan and her advisors would be to figure out what type of income she will be getting,\" Avani Ramnani, director of financial planning and wealth management at Francis Financial, told Business Insider. \"Will this income be from the investments of a trust, or 'wages' for any work that she does, or any other type of income? Sometimes, getting one form of income is more advantageous than another.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kensington Palace will cover the cost of the wedding — aside from Markle's dress — which is expected to cost the royal family upwards of $45 million (£32 million), most of which is allotted for security.\n",
      "\n",
      "That won't be a huge cost burden for Queen Elizabeth, who is of course the wealthiest member of the royal family with an estimated net worth of $530 million as of 2016, according to Forbes.\n",

    "Here's where all that money comes from.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along with Prince William and Kate Middleton, Harry receives an annual seven-figure allowance from his father and heir to the throne, Prince Charles, which is used to cover expenses like travel and wardrobe. Between April 2016 and March 2017, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Harry split nearly $5 million (£3.5 million) in allowance from their father, according to an annual review released by Clarence House.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prince Charles derives that money, in part, from a private estate called the Duchy of Cornwall, which has funded the royal family's public and private lives for nearly 700 years. The estate provided a total of $28.8 million (£20.7 million), including Harry and William's allowance, to Prince Charles and his wife Camilla between 2016 and 2017.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Since age 21, Harry and William have also been receiving a $450,000 a year investment profit from Princess Diana's estate, which they pay taxes on to the UK government. They received a sizeable inheritance from their late mother estimated to be around $10 million each, which each prince gained access to on his 30th birthday. Plus, during his 10 years in the British Royal Air Force, Harry earned an annual income of $50,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite a massive fortune, Markle and Harry reportedly will not sign a prenuptial agreement before their wedding, reported Business Insider's Shana Lebowtiz.\n",
    "\n",
    "A prenup is a smart choice for most couples who have sizable assets they want to protect in the event of a divorce, but for Harry — and William, who chose to forgo a prenup with Middleton — it doesn't make much sense. The princes likely don't have much property of their own, as the most valuable national treasures like the Crown Jewels or the Tower of London are part of the royal collection held by the Queen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, the merging of Harry and Markle's finances could \"cause tax headaches\" and create some \"mundane hurdles\" for the royal family, as The Washington Post first reported in November.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markle is a citizen of the US and is purportedly living in the UK on a family visa, according to the BBC. If she eventually becomes a dual US-UK citizen, Markle will have to continue filing her taxes each year with the IRS. If she has more than $300,000 in assets at any point during the year, she will have to file a specific form that details foreign assets, which could include foreign trusts, subjecting the royal family \"to outside scrutiny,\" according to the Post. But ultimately there are a lot of factors that come into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eddie Mulholland/AP\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The key for Meghan and her advisors would be to figure out what type of income she will be getting,\" Avani Ramnani, director of financial planning and wealth management at Francis Financial, told Business Insider. \"Will this income be from the investments of a trust, or 'wages' for any work that she does, or any other type of income? Sometimes, getting one form of income is more advantageous than another.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Kensington Palace will cover the cost of the wedding — aside from Markle's dress — which is expected to cost the royal family upwards of $45 million (£32 million), most of which is allotted for security.\n",
    "\n",
    "That won't be a huge cost burden for Queen Elizabeth, who is of course the wealthiest member of the royal family with an estimated net worth of $530 million as of 2016, according to Forbes.\n",
